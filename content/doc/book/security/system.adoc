System-wide settings related to security accomplish several goals:

. Set up Jenkins to make use of infrastructure, e.g., for distributed builds.
. Set up features that ensure Jenkins users are safe from potential attacks.
. Ensure that job-level (mis)configuration does not negatively affect the system.

Several system-wide options only provide a default, or a framework, that can then be further refined on individual items, like jobs.
