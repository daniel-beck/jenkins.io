title: Securing Jenkins
---

Jenkins is used everywhere from workstations on corporate intranets, to high-powered servers connected to the public internet.
To safely support this wide spread of security and threat profiles, Jenkins offers many configuration options for enabling, customizing, or disabling various security features.

Many of the security options are enabled by default when passing the interactive setup wizard to ensure that Jenkins is secure.
Others involve environment-specific setup and trade-offs and depend on specific use cases supported in individual Jenkins instances.

// TODO: Also not immediately security-related features
This chapter will introduce the various security options available to Jenkins administrators and users, explaining the protections offered, and trade-offs to disabling some of them.
It is split into sections for each of the following topics:

//* Initial Setup explores the default settings and the motivation for them.
* Infrastructure discusses the considerations for and impact of the environment into which Jenkins is deployed.
* System-wide settings, which include authentication and authorization of Jenkins users, making use of infrastructure for distributed builds, and other settings that protect Jenkins and Jenkins users from attacks.
* Security considerations when configuring individual jobs.
