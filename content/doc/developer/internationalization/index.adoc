= Internationalization and Localization

Internationalization (sometimes referred to as i18n) is the process of designing software so it can be adapted to multiple languages and regions.
Localization (or l10n) is the adaptation of software to a specific region or language.

This chapter explains how internationalization is implemented in Jenkins, as well as the tools to support both internationalization and localization.
